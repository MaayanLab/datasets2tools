                    "With the rapid emergence of technologies for locating cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) genome-wide, the next pressing challenge is to assign precise functions to each CRM, i.e. to determine the spatiotemporal domains or cell-types where it drives expression. A popular approach to this task is to model the typical k-mer composition of a set of CRMs known to drive a common expression pattern, and assign that pattern to other CRMs exhibiting a similar k-mer composition. This approach does not rely on prior knowledge of transcription factors relevant to the CRM or their binding motifs, and is thus more widely applicable than motif-based methods for predicting CRM activity, but is also prone to false positive predictions."

                    "We present a novel strategy to improve the above-mentioned approach: to predict if a CRM drives a specific gene expression pattern, assess not only how similar the CRM is to other CRMs with similar activity but also to CRMs with distinct activities. We use a state-of-the-art statistical method to quantify a CRM\u2019s sequence similarity to many different training sets of CRMs, and employ a classification algorithm to integrate these similarity scores into a single prediction of the CRM\u2019s activity. This strategy is shown to significantly improve CRM activity prediction over current approaches."

                    "Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task."

While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge."

Statistical significance is determined using a multivariate permutation null distribution.

In a simulation study, we showed that multi-biospecimen testing procedures were more powerful than single-biospecimen methods when compounds are differentially regulated in multiple biospecimens but univariate methods can be more powerful if compounds are differentially regulated in only one biospecimen."
